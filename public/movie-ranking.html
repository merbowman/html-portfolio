<h1>The Best Movies According to Meredith</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>PURPLE RAIN</h3>
<p>For me this movie represents, the greatness of the 1980's and my discovery of music. Music that was mine, not my parents. Music that spoke to me. 
    Prince created a movie musical masterpiece that will never be surpassed. </p>

<h3>VIVA LAS VEGAS</h3>
<p>Elvis at his visual best. The movie plot is nothing great but it showcases EP and Ann-Margaret with singing and dancing magic. 
    It's truly great to see them play off one another's abilities. Plus both were easy on the eyes.</p>

<h3>COMING TO AMERICA</h3>
<p>This movie never grows old. Eddie Murphy at his finest in multiple roles.</p>
